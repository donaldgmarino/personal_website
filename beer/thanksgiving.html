<span class='beer_title'>Thanksgiving Ale 2007 :: October 28, 2007</span><br/><br/>
I hosted 12 people for Thanksgiving this year. Along with the turkey, I provided a special brew made just for the occasion. I think this will become an annual tradition!<br/><br/>

<strong>Procedure</strong>

Steep the chocolate malt in 2 gallons of water as it comes to a boil.<br/>
When wort begins to boil, remove grains and add the malt extract, and a little more than one ounce of each hop variety.<br/>
Boil at rolling boil for one hour.<br/>
Add the remaining hops for the last 2 minutes of the boil, the remove from heat.<br/>
Run wort chiller for 20 minutes, then combine with 3 gallons cold water in the fermenter.<br/>
Pitch yeast when cool enough.<br/>
I racked this beer into a clean 5 gallon carboy after 7 days and fermented another 6 days.<br/>
Bottle with 3/4 cup primimg sugar as usual.

<strong>Tasting Notes</strong>

This beer turned out darn good. Nice, medium bodied ale, just on the copper side of brown. The chocolate malt character is evident and pretty much carries through, while the hops do a decent job of balancing things out. We drank almost this whole 5 gallon batch on Thanksgiving this year! This recipe doesn't need much tuning. I would brew it again without changing too much. Something to give better head retention would be good. This beer was ready very early, great after just two weeks in the bottle.
