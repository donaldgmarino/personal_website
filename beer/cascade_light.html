<strong>Tasting Notes</strong>
<hr color=#d6cdbe size=1 />
This beer turned out pretty good. Very light in body and mouthfeel. Not as much hop aroma as I hoped, but the hops are there. The crystal malt helped this beer a lot, otherwise it would have not had much body at all. A bit more bittering hops next time would help balance this beer out. Very drinkable.
