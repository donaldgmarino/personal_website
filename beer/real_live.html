<strong>Procedure</strong>
<hr color="#d6cdbe" size="1" />
Heat 3 gallons water slowly to about 180&deg; F with the grain steeping in a grain bag. When mixture reaches 180&deg; or so, remove grain bag, allowing wort to drain out of grain bag. Cast aside grain bag and bring mixture slowly to a boil. When wort begins to boil, remove from heat and add the liquid malt extract and the malto-dextrin. When extract has dissolved, return to heat. When wort reaches boil, add first hops. Boil gently for 30 minutes and add thesecond hops. Boil for 15 more minutes (45 total) and add the third hops. When boil time is ~2 min shy of 1 hour, add the finishing hops and stir for the remaining few minutes. Remove from heat and run wort chiller for ~20-30 minutes. Add to cold water in the fermenter to make 5.25 gallons or so. Pitch the yeast when wort reaches 70&deg;, aerate well and affix the airlock.<br />
I dry-hopped this beer with fresh, whole-leaf Cascade Hops, but procrastination set in and I left this in the secondary with the hops all year until November. Regardless, the beer turned out well, we enjoyed it on November 4th, 2011

<strong>Tasting Notes</strong>

This beer turned out well, despite the long stay in the secondary fermenter. Had a happy hour at my house and all of this beer was consumed in very short order, with many compliments from the assembled. Would maybe tweak a little next time, but overall, a decent IPA
