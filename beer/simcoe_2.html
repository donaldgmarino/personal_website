<span class='beer_title'>Simcoe American Pale Ale :: February 17, 2008</span><br/><br/>
I have been trying to continually refine my recipe for American Pale Ale, as this style is the mainstay of my beer drinking. I was pretty pleased with my initial beer, the Simcoe Danger Brew, so I thought I would make the next iteration of this beer, with some adjustments. This is my fourth attempt at brewing American Pale Ale, the second that featured Simcoe hops for bittering.<br/><br/>

<strong>Procedure</strong>

Add the grains to a boiling bag, place into 2.5 gallons cold water and heat to a boil. When boil commences, remove grain bag, add the malt extract and the Simcoe hops. Boil this mixture for one hour at a rolling boil. Add the Centennial hops for the last two minutes of the boil, then remove and run the wort chiller until wort has cooled. Combine the wort with another 3 gallons cold water in the 6.5 gallon fermenter.

The yeast procedure was a bit unusual this time around. I thought I would try an experiment and re-use the live yeast I had on hand. I had, just prior to brewing this beer, racked my Longmont Honey Amber Ale to the secondary and had a couple of inches of yeast slurry left in the fermenter. I sterilized a glass, poured about 8-12 ounces of yeast sludge into it, and sealed it off with saran wrap and ziplock bags. I put this into the fridge for the two hours or so that I was brewing this APA. I then cleaned and sterilized the fermenter for use. When the APA wort was ready in the fermenter, I poured this yeast slurry directly into the fermenter and affixed the airlock. This was highly successful and I have never seen fermentation so vigorous. This yeast went off like a bomb in my wort! Very cool, and I was able to save the WLP001 California Ale yeast I had intended to use for this beer for another time.

Bottle with 3/4 cup primimg sugar as usual. I left this beer in the primary for about 3 weeks and bottled it from there without racking into the secondary.

<strong>Tasting Notes</strong>

Very bitter and tasty. This beer turned out as successfully as any of them have.  This is the second simcoe beer and I definitely will make it again. Very citrusy and floral, this beer was a pleasing hop-heavy pale ale. Definitely could drink a few of these at once. Pretty refreshing and very good smelling.
