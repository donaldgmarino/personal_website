Heat 2.5 gallons water slowly to about 180&deg; F with the grain steeping in a grain bag. When mixture reaches 180&deg; or so, remove grain bag, allowing wort to drain out of grain bag. Cast aside grain bag and bring mixture slowly to a boil. When wort begins to boil, remove from heat and add the liquid malt extract and the dry malt extract. When extract has dissolved, add the Citra hop pellets and return to heat. Boil gently for 30 minutes and add the Simcoe hop pellets. Boil for 27 more minutes (57 total) and add the Cascade pellets. Only boil Cascade hops for final 2-3 minutes of boil. Remove from heat and run wort chiller for ~20 minutes. Pitch the yeast when wort reaches room temperature and affix the airlock.<br /><br />
