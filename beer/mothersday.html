Put the crushed malt into a boiling bag and add the grains to 1 gallon water. Bring wort to a boil. Remove grain bag, draining as much liquor as possible one the mixture reaches a boil.<br />
As wort begins to boil, add the malt extract. When wort returns to boil, add 2.0 oz Liberty hops. Boil all this for one hour at rolling boil.<br />
Add remaining 2.0 oz hops for the last 15 minutes of the boil, and remove from heat.&nbsp;
<div>Run wort chiller for 15 minutes and combine wort with 3 gallons cold water in the fermenter.<br />
Pitch the yeast at room temperature and affix the airlock.<br />
<br /><strong>Tasting Notes</strong>

Kegged this batch for the first time. Had left this in both the primary and the secondary for a long time, a few weeks apiece. Beer was good, clean tasting and very drinkable. I wanted this beer to be lighter, but this was a little too light. Needed more hops, too. Would want to improve this recipe if I made it again but was pleased with the kegging results. Good, drinkable session ale.</div>
