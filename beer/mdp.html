<strong>Tasting Notes</strong>
<hr color=#d6cdbe size=1 />
This was a mild beer, fairly nondescript. Ended up a little bit too carbonated for a dark porter like this. This beer was better after more time in the bottle, like 5-7 weeks. Not bad, drinkable beer, but a dark porter needs more character than this.
