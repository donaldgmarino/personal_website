Put the crushed malt into a boiling bag and add the grains to 2.25 gallons water. Bring wort to a boil. Remove grain bag, draining as much liquor as possible one the mixture reaches a boil.<br />
As wort begins to boil, add the malt extract syrup and powder. When wort returns to boil, add 2.0 oz Perle hops and add 2.0 oz. Northern Brewer hops. Boil all this for one hour at rolling boil.<br />
For final 2 minutes of boil, remove boiling hops from kettle with strainer and add 2.0 oz. Cascade hops. After 2 minutes, remove kettle from heat and remove as many hops as possible with strainer.
<div>Run wort chiller for 15 minutes and combine wort with cold water in the fermenter to make 5.5 gallons or so.<br />
Pitch the yeast at room temperature and affix the airlock.<br />

This beer was pretty good. Did well in the keg and we drank it all in one night.
