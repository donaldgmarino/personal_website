<strong>Procedure</strong>

Add the grains to 1 gallon water. Bring this mixture up to 150&deg;, stirring regularly. Remove from heat and maintain 150&deg; (or as close as possible) for at least 10 minutes. Return to full heat and bring wort to a boil. <br/>
When mixture begins to boil, strain the mixture into the brewpot, removing spent grains. Add 2 gallons of cold water to the brewpot and return to heat.<br/>
As wort nears boil, add the malt extract. When wort returns to boil, add 1 oz. hallertaur hops. Boil all this for one hour at rolling boil.<br/>
Add remaining hops for the last 2 minutes of the boil, and remove from heat. Run wort chiller for 15 minutes and combine wort with 3 gallons cold water in the 6 gallon fermenter.<br/>
Pitch the yeast and affix the airlock.

<strong>Tasting Notes</strong>
<hr color=#d6cdbe size=1 />
This beer stayed too long in the secondary because I was procrastinating bottling it. I believe the yeast began to lose vigor. The result was beer that didn't bottle ferment very well and will go flat in just a short time. This beer is otherwise unremarkable, not my best effort.
