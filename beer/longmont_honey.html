<span class='beer_title'>Longmont Honey Amber Ale :: January 9th, 2008</span><br/><br/>
I discovered that the National Honey Board is located here in my town of Longmont, Colorado, and that we have two very good honey growers here in town as well. I got some of the raw, unfiltered locally grown honey and made an Amber Ale featuring the sweet stuff.<br/><br/>

<li>1/8 lb. crushed Belgian Biscuit Malt</li>
<li>1/8 lb. crushed Chocolate Malt</li>

<li>2.0 oz. Northern Brewer Hops, fresh whole leaf (8.5% aa)</li>

<strong>Procedure</strong>

Put the chocolate malt into one boiling bag, put the other specialty grains into another. Add both grain bags to 2 gallons water and begin to bring to a boil. Remove the grain bag with the chocolate malt after just a few minutes, as it is just here for color, and we aren't going all the way to a brown ale color. Leave the other grain bag in the water until it begins to boil, then discard. When boil commences, add the honey, the malt extract, and the Chinook hops. Boil this at a rolling boil for one hour. Add the Northern Brewer hops for the last two minutes of the boil, then remove from heat. Run the wort chiller until cool. Combine with 3 gallons cold water in the fermenter and pitch the yeast culture. I racked this beer into the secondary after 9 days. Leave this beer in the secondary for a month, as the honey will take some time to fully ferment, and the aging will help this beer mellow as well. Bottle as usual with 3/4 cup priming sugar.

Very strong amber beer. This is no session beer, but one to be enjoyed from time to time when craving something a little different.
