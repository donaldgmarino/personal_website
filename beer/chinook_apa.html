<strong>Tasting Notes</strong>
<hr color=#d6cdbe size=1 />
Some of this beer was very good, while I had an infection on at least half of the bottles. The uninfected samples of this beer were very close to what I'd expected. A very hoppy, medium/light bodied Pale Ale with pronounced hop nose, this was quite good and drinkable. I was disappointed to have my first skunky beer since resuming the brew-works last June, but I suppose it's inevitable to have some problems sometime in home brewing. At least the recipe was solid. I will continue to refine the American Pale Ale recipe, this was my third such beer, and I've since brewed another version of the APA.
