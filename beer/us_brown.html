<strong>Procedure</strong>
<hr color=#d6cdbe size=1 />
Steep specialty grains in 1 gallon water. Raise water to 150&deg; and remove from heat. Keep as close to 150&deg; as possible for 30 minutes.<br/>
After 30 minutes, strain this mixture into the brewpot, through a strainer, following with 1 gallon 130&deg; water to simulate sparging. Add more hot water to brewpot to total 2 gallons.<br/>
Bring this to a boil, and add the malt extract.<br/>
When the wort returns to a boil, add the Malto-dextrin, and 1.25 oz. Northern Brewer hops.<br/>
Boil for 30 minutes, then add the Irish Moss and an additional 3/4 oz. Northern Brewer hops.<br/>
Boil for 15 more minutes, then add 3/4 oz. Cascade hops.<br/>
Boil another 15 minutes, then add the remaining 1.25 oz. or so of Cascade hops.<br/>
Only boil for 2 more minutes, then remove from heat.<br/>
Run wort chiller for 20 minutes, leaving the hops in the wort.<br/>
Remove hops with clean strainer, then combine wort with 3 gallons cold water in the fermenter.<br/>
Pitch yeast into cooled wort.<br/>
Racked into clean 5 gallon carboy after 9 days in the primary. Continue to ferment in the secondary for another week.</br>
Bottle with the usual 3/4 cup priming sugar.

<strong>Tasting Notes</strong>
<hr color=#d6cdbe size=1 />
This beer turned out beautifully; a nice dark brown, well-balanced beer, with a decent amount of hop nose. I thought this was one of my more successful efforts and was quite reminiscent of a Pete's Wicked Ale. Very drinkable and an encouraging sign of progress in the home brewery!
