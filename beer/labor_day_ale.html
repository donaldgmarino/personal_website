Heat 2.5 gallons water slowly to about 180&deg; F with the grain steeping in a grain bag. When mixture reaches 180&deg; or so, remove grain bag, allowing wort to drain out of grain bag. Cast aside grain bag and bring mixture slowly to a boil. When wort begins to boil, remove from heat and add the liquid malt extract and the dry malt extract. When extract has dissolved, add the Nugget hop pellets and return to heat. Boil gently for 30 minutes and add the Cascade hop pellets. Boil for 15 more minutes (45 total) and add the Centennial pellets. When boil time is 3 min shy of 1 hour, add the whole Cascade hops and stir for the remaining 3 minutes. Remove from heat and strain as much hop pellet and hops as is pracitcal. Run wort chiller for ~20 minutes. Pitch the yeast when wort reaches room temperature and affix the airlock.<br /><br />

Simply put, this was the best beer I have made yet. The 5-gallon keg was consumed at a BBQ pit party and it went down well with said BBQ!
