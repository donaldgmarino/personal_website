<span class='beer_title'>Simcoe Danger Brew :: July 2007</span><br/><br/>
I read about simcoe hops online somewhere, and then when I saw them at the store, I thought I'd feature them in a light-medium bodied Pale Ale.<br/><br/>

<strong>Ingredients for 5 gallons</strong><br/>
<hr size=1 color=#d6cdbe />
<ul>
  <li>3.5 lb. Munton's Light Malt Extract Syrup</li>
  <li>2 lb. Munton's Amber Malt Extract Syrup</li>
  <li>2 oz. Simcoe Hops (14.5% aa)! , fresh whole leaf</li>
  <li>2 oz. Cascade Hops (6.0% aa), fresh whole leaf</li>
  <li>1 tbsp. Gypsum</li>
  <li>1 pkg. Safale US-05 American Ale Yeast</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong>Procedure</strong><br/>
<hr size=1 color=#d6cdbe />
Bring 2 gallons of water to a boil in your brewpot.<br/>
Once the water boils, add the gypsum and malt extract, using the boiling water to get all of the extract out of the cans. Do this off of the heat, so that the extract does not burn onto the bottom of the pot.<br/>
Adding this room temperature extract will lower the mixture below boiling. Return to heat. When mixture returns to a boil, add 2 oz. Simcoe hops and 1 oz. Cascade Hops.<br/>
Remove 1/2 of the boiling hops with a sanitized strainer at 30 minutes.<br/>
Continue to boil for 30 more minutes, totalling 1 hour.<br/>
Add the remaining ounce of Cascade hops for the last 2 minutes of the boil and remove from heat.<br/>
Strain wort into carboy. Pitch yeast when cool.<br/>
Fermented for 2 weeks in a 6.5 gallon carboy.<br/>
Bottled with 3/4 cup priming sugar. Bottle condition for at least 2 weeks, longer is better.

<strong>Tasting Notes</strong><br/>
<hr size=1 color=#d6cdbe />
This beer had a very floral, citrusy nose. It was quite bitter with pronounced simcoe character. This beer could have had more body. A little more malt extract next time, and maybe some Crystal Malt. Very drinkable, hoppy, and well-received by all.
